---
There should be a LSM hook to call tinfoil_verify ideally
This could prevent a physical access backdoor from being trivally
exploited via a poisoned init program placed by the attacker
This also helps	prevent	a successful hack of a computer	while     
running	from putting a poisoned init causing LUKS encryption
password from being disclosed to the adversary




#ifdef CONFIG_TINFOIL
