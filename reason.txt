Allow the user to sign a file containing checksums and file paths for files be
validated before "init" happens in a manner where the public key cannot be
changed without recomiplation of the kernel and signing of the kernel.

make the kernel validate arbitrary files visible at boot and after opening of
the initramfs but before calling init by using a signed file and a public key
embedded in the kernel at build that cannot be changed without recompilation
and subsequent resigning of the kernel

get rid of global since this purely procedural
